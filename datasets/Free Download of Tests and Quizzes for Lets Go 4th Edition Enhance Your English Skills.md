Let's Go 4th Edition is based on the communicative approach to language teaching. This means that the books focus on helping students use English in real-life situations. The books also use a spiral curriculum, which means that the same topics and language points are revisited at different levels with increasing complexity and depth. This helps students review and consolidate what they have learned before moving on to new material.
